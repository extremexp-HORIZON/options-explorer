  summary: Register a New User
  deprecated: false
  description: >
    This endpoint allows users to create a new account by providing their personal details, email, password, and profile picture. 
    The password is hashed using MD5 with a salt before storing it. If the registration is successful, the user’s information is stored, 
    and a success response is returned. If the provided profile picture is missing or not in an allowed format (PNG, JPG, JPEG), 
    the request will be rejected with a 400 Bad Request error. For security reasons, it is recommended to use a stronger hashing 
    algorithm such as bcrypt. Ensure that sensitive information is securely handled.
