  summary: User Login
  deprecated: false
  description: >
    This endpoint allows users to authenticate by providing their email and password. The password is hashed using MD5 with a salt before validation. 
    If the credentials are correct, the system generates and returns an access token and a refresh token, which should be used for authenticated requests. 
    If authentication fails, a 401 Unauthorized response is returned. 
    **Security Note:** MD5 is not a secure hashing algorithm; using a stronger hashing method like bcrypt is recommended. 
    Ensure tokens are securely stored and refreshed appropriately.
