  summary: Add Experiment
  deprecated: false
  description: >
    This endpoint allows authenticated users to add a new experiment. 
    The user must provide experiment details, including the title, domain, intent, algorithm, method, model, 
    and a list of descriptions. The request must be sent in JSON format and include a valid JWT access token 
    in the Authorization header. If successful, the experiment is stored and a success response is returned. 
    If authentication fails, a 401 Unauthorized response is returned.
